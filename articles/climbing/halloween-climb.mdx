Halloween comes around every year. And every year I am excited for the opportunity
to wear a Halloween costume! That excitement is then followed by the desire to create a new
and exciting custume and then again by sadness as I am unwilling to give up yet another
part of my house to yet another hobby.

## Stone Gardens Halloween Event

This year Stone Gardens invited members to show up and climb in costume! So here is a photo
of me rocking my Gurren Lagan Simone cosplay. Or at least parts of it.

The coat is home made out of a cotton material and climbing in it was **HOT**. I did not even
wear the prop goggles I made and they fogged up just being nearby.

Still it was fun to try, and cool to see other people climbing in their costumes! Climbing really
doesnt lend itself well to wearing costumes! I wish I had a picture of some of the other climbers
to show you guys!
